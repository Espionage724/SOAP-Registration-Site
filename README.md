# SOAP-Registration-Site
SOAP-based registration site for World of Warcraft private servers

This replaces the old-method of injecting accounts directly into MySQL databases. Tested for use on TrinityCore, and probably easily adaptable for other server emulators.

Original code by Jeutie and Chocochaos. Modified and stripped down by me.
